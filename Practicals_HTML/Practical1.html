    <h2>About the Course</h2>
    <div>
       <strong>Full-stack</strong>  refers to a group of programming languages and tools a developer learns to handle both the front-end and back-end development of a website.<br>
        The Front end stack is made up of many different languages and libraries. While these vary from application to application, there are only a few generic languages understood by all web browsers. These three main front-end coding languages are <strong>HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</strong><br>
        The Back- end of a website consists of a server, an application, and a database. A back-end developer builds and maintains the technology that powers those components which, together, enable the user-facing side of the website to even exist in the first place.
